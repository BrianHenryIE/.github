## Feature Request

#### ⚠️ Before you describe your requested feature...

**Is your feature request directly related to a specific, existing command?**

If yes, make sure you are in the correct repository that contains the command you are referring to, and only create the issue in that repository.

If you are not in the correct repository right now, you can just close this issue/window without submitting and click through to the correct one.

**Is your feature request about a new command, or a more general idea?**

If yes, head over to the [`wp-cli/ideas`](https://github.com/wp-cli/ideas) repository and [create a new issue in that repository](https://github.com/wp-cli/ideas/issues/new).

#### ✅ If you are in the correct location now... 

**Describe your use case and the problem you are facing**

A clear and concise description of what you are actually trying to do, and in what way the current version of WP-CLI is not up to the task.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Add any considered drawbacks if you can think of any.
